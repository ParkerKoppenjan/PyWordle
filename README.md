# PyWordle
A Python implementation of Wordle focusing on efficient data structures and clean object-oriented design. Uses sets for O(1) word validation, dictionaries for letter tracking, and colored terminal output. Demonstrates file I/O, input validation, and game state management while maintaining separation between valid guesses and possible answers.
